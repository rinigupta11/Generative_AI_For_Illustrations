# Generative AI For Illustrations

Many books, particularly novels, do not have illustrations. Illustrations are a useful way of understanding the setting and characters of a book. Illustrations help us to imagine the world the novel creates in an effective and immersive way. Using natural language processing and generative neural networks, I aim to take the text of a book (for this project, it will be Harry Potter), and generate illustrations using DALL-E or Stable Diffusion.
